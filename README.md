GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

Definition: Total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time.

3 Approaches:

Production approach → Sum of value of final goods/services (avoid double counting by focusing on value added).

Income approach → Wages + Rent + Interest + Profits + Taxes – Subsidies. Measures who earned from production.

Expenditure approach → C + I + G + (X – M). Measures who spent on final goods/services:

C = Household consumption

I = Investment (businesses + housing + inventories)

G = Government spending (goods/services, not transfers)

(X – M) = Exports – Imports (corrects for foreign goods/services).

✅ Key idea: All 3 approaches give the same GDP, since every spending = someone’s income = some production.

🔹 GDP per Capita

Formula: GDP ÷ Population.

Meaning: Average income or spending per person theoretically (not actual income).

Shows the size of the cake per person, not how it’s sliced (ignores inequality).

Useful for comparing living standards across countries.

🔹 Critiques & Limitations of GDP

GDP misses many things:

Health & education quality (only fees/expenses are counted).

Leisure time (working more can raise GDP but lower wellbeing).

Environment (pollution, depletion ignored).

Unpaid work (family care, volunteering not included).

✅ GDP growth isn’t always “good” → hospital bills, natural disasters, or pollution can raise GDP while lowering wellbeing.

🔹 Resource Depletion & Sustainability

Natural capital depletion: Oil, gas, fish, forests.

Environmental depletion: Pollution, biodiversity loss.

Human depletion: Burnout, poor healthcare/education, brain drain.

If GDP per capita was adjusted for depletion, many resource-rich countries (e.g. Nigeria) would show lower or even negative growth.

Norway’s model: Offsets oil depletion by saving & investing in its Sovereign Wealth Fund (converts natural capital → financial capital).


✅ Key Takeaways for Today

GDP ≠ wellbeing; it’s just a measure of production.

GDP per capita = average slice of the cake, not how it’s divided.

Sustainability matters: depletion and pollution can make GDP misleading.

People and skills are as important as natural resources for long-term growth.
